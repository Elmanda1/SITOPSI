# Project structure

This repository holds two main parts:

- `vb_app/` : VB.NET application (UI and DB) — fill with your existing forms and code.
- `python_experts/` : Python AI engine used by the VB app for inference.

I created placeholder files to match the structure you requested. Fill each placeholder with your real code or paste the files you already have.

If you want, I can now:
- Copy the actual VB files from your `ProjectPBL` subfolder into `vb_app` and wire them up.
- Implement a simple CLI for `python_experts/main.py` so VB can call it and get JSON responses.
- Add example rules and a tiny unit test for the Python engine.

Tell me which of the above you'd like next.
